/*
 * An example of how to use signals to implement a timer facility using 
 * POSIX threads.
 *
 * Rationale: when using normal Unix signals (SIGALRM), the signal handler executes
 * in a signal handler context.  In a signal handler context, only async-signal-safe
 * functions may be called.  Few POSIX functions are async-signal-safe.
 *
 * Instead of handling the timer activity in the signal handler function,
 * we create a separate thread to perform the timer activity.
 * This timer thread receives a signal from a semaphore, which is signaled ("posted")
 * every time a timer signal arrives.
 *
 * You'll have to redefine "timer_func" below and "set_periodic_timer."
 *
 * Read the man pages of the functions used, such as signal(2), signal(7),
 * alarm(2).
